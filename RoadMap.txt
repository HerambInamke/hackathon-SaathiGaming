# Saathi Gaming: Technical Implementation Plan

## Core Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React Native for cross-platform mobile app
- Next.js for web platform
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Socket.io for real-time features
- React Context + Redux for state management

### Backend
- Node.js/Express for main server
- Python/FastAPI for ML services
- MongoDB for user data
- Redis for caching/real-time features
- Firebase for notifications

### ML/AI Components
- TensorFlow for behavior analysis
- Natural Language Processing for multi-language support
- Sentiment Analysis for mood tracking
- Anomaly Detection for fraud prevention

## Key Components Implementation

### 1. Digital Dost System
```typescript
interface DigitalDostEngine {
  userPreferences: {
    language: string;
    gamingStyle: string;
    playTimes: TimeRange[];
    skillLevel: number;
  };
  
  behaviorTracking: {
    playDuration: number;
    moodPatterns: Pattern[];
    achievementHistory: Achievement[];
    socialInteractions: Interaction[];
  };
  
  notifications: {
    breakReminders: Reminder[];
    achievements: Achievement[];
    socialUpdates: Update[];
    wellnessChecks: Check[];
  };
}
```

### 2. Family Connect Module
```typescript
interface FamilySystem {
  familyProfile: {
    members: FamilyMember[];
    preferences: FamilyPreferences;
    restrictions: ParentalControls;
  };
  
  monitoring: {
    playTime: TimeTracking;
    content: ContentFiltering;
    spending: SpendingLimits;
  };
  
  activities: {
    familyTournaments: Tournament[];
    groupAchievements: Achievement[];
    learningProgress: Progress[];
  };
}
```

### 3. Community Features
```typescript
interface CommunitySystem {
  matchmaking: {
    buddySystem: BuddyMatcher;
    mentorship: MentorshipEngine;
    groupActivities: GroupManager;
  };
  
  events: {
    tournaments: TournamentManager;
    festivals: FestivalEvents;
    workshops: SkillWorkshops;
  };
  
  moderation: {
    contentFilter: ContentModerator;
    userReports: ReportHandler;
    communityGuidelines: GuidelineEnforcer;
  };
}
```
